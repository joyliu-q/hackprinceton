## Inspiration
As members of Penn Labs, a club at the University of Pennsylvania, teaching Git to newcomers is a recurring task for us. This sparked our interest in exploring how emerging technologies like AR can transform educational experiences, particularly in understanding and utilizing current technologies like Git more effectively.

## What it does
"Kepler" transcends traditional educational methods by offering an immersive Git metaverse. It enables users to:
- Visualize any GitHub repository in Virtual Reality and/or Augmented Reality, making Git learning intuitive and engaging.
- Navigate and walk through the repository's history, including branches and commits, on iOS devices or on Apple Vision Pro.
- Access detailed views of commits, including diffs, to learn Git hands-on.
- Leverage AI to uncover insights, patterns, and key contributors, enhancing understanding of the project's development dynamics. Discover story arcs, bug fixes, team roles, and project objectives in a novel way.
- Identify suspicious patterns to flag potential integrity issues in hackathons.
- Allow repository maintainers to analyze contributor trends, fostering a more collaborative open-source development environment.
- Provide recruiters with deep insights into an applicant's project contributions.
- Enable applicants to walk recruiters through their project contributions in a more interactive manner.
- Preserve commit history as an internet artifact, ensuring longevity and accessibility.

## How we built it
Our journey in bringing Kepler to life involved a mix of Swift programming, AR/VR technologies, and AI integration, utilizing tools and platforms:

## Challenges we ran into
The Kepler project was a rewarding and enriching journey of learning and adaptation, highlighted by:
- The first-time use of Swift and AR/VR technologies by two team members.
- The first hackathon experience for a member, who also transitioned to using a Mac for the first time this week.
- Adapting existing software packages for compatibility with visionOS, including forking and modifying the CodeViewer package.
- Implementing advanced features like topological graph sorting, zoom/collision interactions, and physics in the AR.
- Bridging the gap between AR and VR, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Kepler stands out for both its educational potential and its technical achievements, including:
- Successful deployment on both iOS and visionOS, with interactive and engaging user experiences.
- Integration of diverse features such as AR/VR, AI, and NFT minting into a cohesive educational tool.
- Implementation of additional interactive elements like particle effects, sound effects, and custom gestures, enriching the user experience.

## What we learned
- Intricacies of math, coordinates, collisions, and physics in AR environments.
- Swift programming and AR/VR development, especially for team members new to these areas.
- Developing for and translating experiences between iOS and visionOS.
- The challenges and rewards of incorporating a wide range of features and technologies into a single project, facilitated by the support of HackPrinceton's sponsors.

## What's next for Kepler
Looking ahead, we want to improve Kepler's capabilities by:
- Integrating AI further to analyze issues, comments, and diffs for even deeper insights into Git repositories.
- Implementing caching for diffs, database support, and pagination.
- Adding support for private repository authentication, broadening Kepler's applicability to a wider range of Git projects.
-Integration with IDEs to allow developers to access Kepler's insights and visualization capabilities directly within their coding environments, bridging the gap between code writing and version control learning.
